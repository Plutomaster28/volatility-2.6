# WHAT IS THIS
This is Volatility, which I got from [here](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility)
But it's in python2, which is stupid, so I took the time to try and port it to python3

## It's like, 99% good
Minus for 2 scripts, which are on the following paths:
- volatility-2.6\volatility-master\volatility\plugins\addrspaces\ieee1394.py
- volatility-2.6\volatility-master\setup.py

Don't forget to download all the necessary libraries! That aren't yknow, depricated-
